## About This Project

Hello 
This project is a **NPS Dashboard** developed using **React.js**.
I created this project as part of my **3rd Year Web Development coursework** to understand how modern web applications are built using a component-based approach.

The dashboard displays customer information, statistics, and action buttons similar to real-world business dashboards.
